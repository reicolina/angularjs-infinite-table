# angularjs-infinite-table

This project is a sortable HTML table with infinite scrolling implemented with Angular JS. The data I used to populate this table is taken from [Reddit's public API](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api).

## Getting Started

See angularjs directive implementation in app/index.html or browse directly to http://reinaldo13.github.io/angularjs-infinite-table/app/ to see the table in action!

## Dependencies

This projects uses [ngInfiniteScroll](https://binarymuse.github.io/ngInfiniteScroll/index.html) and implements a modified version of [angular-table](http://angulartable.com/)

## Supported Browsers

All modern browsers are supported:

* Windows: Chrome latest, Firefox latest, Internet Explorer 9+
* OSX: Chrome latest, Firefox latest, Safari Latest
* IE8<, IOS 4<, and Android 3< are not currently supported since they don't support getComputedStyle.

## Testing

Coming Soon!
